# Electronics-Store

## Introduction

C++ is a general-purpose programming language. It has imperative, object-oriented and generic programming features, while also providing facilities for low-level memory manipulation.
I decided to build upon a electronic store system that could help with managing product details. The program keeps a full check of the products by asking their product number, brand number and other important information. The program further helps the user to search through records, sort them and even delete the ones not required thereby making the program completely functional and operational for real-life applications without any failure. 

In this program I have made different functions for all these tasks:

●	Customer():This function checks for the availability of a product and calculates the total cost to be paid.

●	Add():This function takes all the details from the user of the program.

●	DisplayAll():This function Displays all the details of a product. 

●	Delete(): This function deletes the product from the database. 

●	Edit(): this function allows the admin to modify product details. 

I have made two ends for the user in the program, an admin end and a user end. From the Admin end you can Add a product, edit a product or Remove the product from the database. From the User end you can purchase a product and check upon its availability.
